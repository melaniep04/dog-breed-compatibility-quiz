# description
This web-based quiz was created for people who want to adopt a dog but have no idea what breed they should get. After answering some questions about what they're looking for in a dog, they will receive three suggestions based on their responses. This ultimately promotes the importance of compatibility to potential dog owners who may have originally just picked a breed based on aesthetics. Therefore, this quiz supports a more fulfilling life for both parties.
