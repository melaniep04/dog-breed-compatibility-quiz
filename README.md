# description
This web-based quiz was created for people who want to adopt a dog but have no idea what breed they should get. After answering some questions about what they're looking for in a dog, they will receive three breed suggestions based on their responses. This project ultimately promotes the importance of compatibility to potential dog owners, as they may have originally just picked a dog breed based on aesthetics. This quiz can play a role in supporting a more fulfilling life for both parties.
